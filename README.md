*NOTE: The curent version of the paper has an issue where figure 8 is duplicated with figure 5. The correct figure 8 will be updated soon in the paper. Meanwhile if you are interested, you can contact [me](#contact) for the correct figure.*

## Web Applications

Interactive Google Earth Engine (GEE) applications is available to explore the flood susceptibility in Pakistan at various scales.

- **Access App**: [Flood Susceptibility Mapping Pakistan](https://waleedgeo-ee.projects.earthengine.app/view/fsm-pk)
- **Features**:
  - Interactive map to visualize flood susceptibility for Pakistan
  - See flood susceptibility for different provinces with their susceptibility levels
  - Select province and district
  - Visualize FSM for respective province and district with flood susceptibility levels

Note: Here flood susceptibility levels are classified into 5 classes: **Very Low**, **Low**, **Moderate**, **High**, and **Very High**. The values are the area under each class in square kilometers shown as percentage of the total area of the province/district.
